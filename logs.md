On week 1, I created the app’s sidebar and stylesheet. I also searched for PDF annotation technologies, and found Apache PDFBOX, which we integrated after. I even created a mini PDF-editing app to test the library’s features. On week 2, I improved several controller mechanisms, added pdf editing view to our app and ensured it worked flawlessly. On week 3, we worked a lot. I added main page controller, create a shelf feature, back buttons to several scenes, rate shelf scene, improved sidebar, chat feature, etc. With Burak, we finalized real-time annotation and chat features, which was a challenging yet educational task.

Between December 9 and December 16, I focused on designing and implementing key features across several views in the application. On December 9, I completed all FXML files for the Settings, Shelf, and YourShelves views. Following feedback and project requirements, I updated and improved the functionality of the Settings views on December 10, making necessary modifications to the FXML files. On December 16, I created the "Remove Member" FXML file along with its controller to handle functionality, added a "Remove Member" icon to the "ShelfSettings" FXML file, and made minor enhancements to the Book Editing interface to improve usability.

In the initial weeks, we reviewed the features we had planned to include and decided to simplify some of them due to potential implementation difficulties. We also revisited topics we learned in class to figure out how to apply them effectively to our project. During the later weeks, we divided responsibilities among the team to ensure a smooth workflow. My main task was to design the visual interface using SceneBuilder. Meanwhile, my teammates focused on other critical parts of the project to keep things progressing steadily. During the remaining weeks, I finalized the scene designs in SceneBuilder and worked on linking them with controllers using JavaFX. As a team, we collaborated to integrate all components into the project and ensured everything functioned as intended. We also completed the required reports together.

In the first week of December, I completed several scenes, including login/sign-up, invitations, recommended shelves, shelf settings, and the controllers for these pages. In the second week, I fixed the controllers from the previous week and added a settings pop-up. I also started establishing connections between the pages. During the final week before the deadline, I added a home button, a rating pop-up, an "add book" pop-up, a "forgot password" pop-up, and a significant portion of the controllers for these scenes. Additionally, I implemented several fixes, such as adjustments to the main menu, cover selection, and chat box size. Lastly, I added functionality to the shelf settings checkboxes. Overall, I successfully handled the scenes and their controllers.

###	Burak Işıner Eker: 

On week 1, I set up a Github repository for our project and pushed the initial commit. I designed an example sidebar as a guide of how we can leverage SceneBuilder. I then started learning MongoDB. I played around with the Java SDK and learned the fundamentals of MongoDB. I started thinking about the details of the model classes. On week 2, I made a significant progress on the DB integration and model implementation. However, I did not make any commit to our repository until the end of the week since I did not want to commit incomplete code. I then finished a very large portion of the database before the end of the week. Here, I implemented the real-time feature for our forum and discussion chat pages but saved the real-time book annotation functionality for later. On week 3, I and Ahmet have made plenty of face-to-face collaborative sessions to integrate our model and controller classes. During one of these sessions, I implemented the real-time annotation feature based on his explanations of what is needed in the controller side.
